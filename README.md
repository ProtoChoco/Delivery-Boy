Unity Project for CS4
This is an incredible basic prototype of a first person shooter I used to teach myself Unity in my junior year of highschool.
I will probably never get around to finishing it, so I am putting it public and licensing it under MIT license. Feel free to use this code as the basis for your work, whether it be open or closed source.
Keep in mind the 3D assets provided here are not OSS and may not be used unless you have purchased a license from SYNTY
